## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I was able to practice quick front end development based on someone else's design. This was good practice sticking to a style guide and trying to clone someone else's design.

### Continued development

I would like to add custom animations and interactions based on hover.
